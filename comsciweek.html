		<h1>Typical Week of a Computer Science Student</h1>
		<p>The University of Sheffield Student's Union is just a 7 minute walk from the Diamond, the building where most of our lectures are in.
		You may being using the Student Union more than you realise, from having your daily meals in one of our SU resturants to getting support and help from the SSiD.</p>

		<p>As a Computer Science and Mathematics student, I usually have my lectures either in the Hicks Building or the Diamond. The Hicks Building is right next to the Student Union
		so I usually spend a lot of time in the Student Union. I always find the Student Union the best place to meet up with your friends as it is the one place everyone in Uni of Sheffield
		know where it is. </p>
		<p>When I first started my life in University of Sheffield, the Student Union had all the help I needed, I was looking for a Part-time job and wanted to volunteer, but I had no
		idea where to start. I went to the Job Shop and one of the staffs was teaching me how I can look for a part time job on their website, I also went to the Volunteering Office after and the staff was very eager to
		help me book in for training and everything to get a profile going for volunteering opportunites. I did not have to worry about anything as they helped me so much and made the process so easy.</p>
