		<h1>Typical Week of a Computer Science Student</h1>
		<p>The University of Sheffield Student's Union is just a 7 minute walk from the Diamond, the building where most of our lectures are in.
		You may being using the Student Union more than you realise, from having your daily meals in one of our SU resturants to getting support and help from the SSiD.</p>
		<h2>Jordan's Typical Week</h2>
		<img src = "" alt = "Jordan's Uni Timetable">
		<p>I am a Computer Science student so most of my lectures and lab classes are in the Diamond and the ones that aren't are always in a building, only a short walk away.
		In my free time I normally spend it in one of the various study spaces within the Diamond.</p>
		<p>I lived in the Endcliffe Village so the Student's Union is roughly 15-20 minute walk away. It is </p>
		<p>Often when walking around I see students with University of Sheffield merch which they have bought from the Student's Union shop or from the website and in my opinion the items they sell look really good and
		are quite cheap.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Helena's Typical Week</h2>
		<img src = "helena ttb.png" alt = "Helena's Uni Timetable">
		<p>As a Computer Science and Mathematics student, I usually have my lectures either in the Hicks Building or the Diamond. The Hicks Building is right next to the Student Union
		so I usually spend a lot of time in the Student Union. I always find the Student Union the best place to meet up with your friends as it is the one place everyone in Uni of Sheffield
		know where it is. </p>
		<p>When I first started my life in University of Sheffield, the Student Union had all the help I needed, I was looking for a Part-time job and wanted to volunteer, but I had no
		idea where to start.</p>
		<p>I went to the Job Shop and one of the staffs was teaching me how I can look for a part time job on their website, I also went to the Volunteering Office after and the staff was very eager to
		help me book in for training and everything to get a profile going for volunteering opportunites. I did not have to worry about anything as they helped me so much and made the process so easy.</p>
		<p>As a student, Students' Union is the best place for a cheap and quick lunch for students. For less than Â£5, you can get a full lunch if you have a short lunch break.</p>
		<p>I was born and raised an Hong Kong and bubble tea is a drink that a grew up with. Whenever I miss home, I just go to Pearls Bubble Tea and grab a nice bubble tea as a treat!</p>
		<p>There are loads of computers and study areas around the Student Union so I spend most of my time there, from revising to finding a new hobby, there is always something for you.</p>
